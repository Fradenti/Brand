Description: The package contains the functions to run both the multivariate and the functional version of the model
    presented in Denti et. al. (2020?). Given a Training set with J mixture components, the package fit a 
    semiparametric model to Test data with J+K components. The first J components are robustly estimated from the Training
    while K is the number of novelties, potentially unbounded.
